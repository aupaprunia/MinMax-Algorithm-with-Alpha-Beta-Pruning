Eval function used for resource limited minmax search with alpha pruning is:

eval_value = 3 * (remaining blue marbles in that state) + 2 * (remaining red marbles in that state)

This would describe the desirability of that state for the player based on the remaining marbles and
accordingly give weighted eval values to each state at given depth level.
